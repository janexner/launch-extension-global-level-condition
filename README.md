# Global Level Conditions

Provides Condition Types that check against 'levels'

'Levels' and a Data Element to check against are defined centrally, so in each Rule, all you need to do is add the Condition Type. No further configuration needed on Rule level.

## 'Above Level N' &amp; 'Below Level N' Condtions

The 'Above Level N' and 'Below Level N' Condition Types can be used to individually set a Condition Level, for example for a specific Rule.
